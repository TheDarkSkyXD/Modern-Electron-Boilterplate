## 4. Technical Architecture and File Structure

### 4.1. Application Architecture Overview
The application follows Electron's multi-process architecture, leveraging the separation between the main process and renderer processes to ensure security, stability, and performance. This architecture enables the application to combine the power of Node.js with the flexibility of web technologies while maintaining native desktop application capabilities.

#### 4.1.1. Main Process Architecture
The main process serves as the application's backbone, responsible for managing the application lifecycle, creating and controlling renderer processes, and handling system-level operations. It operates in a Node.js environment with full access to system APIs and native modules.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Application lifecycle management (startup, shutdown, window management)
- Inter-process communication (IPC) coordination
- Native menu and system tray management
- File system operations and database management
- Authentication token management and secure storage
- Settings persistence through Electron Store
- System notifications and native integrations

**Security Considerations:**
The main process implements strict security measures including context isolation, disabled node integration in renderer processes, and secure IPC channels. All sensitive operations are confined to the main process, with renderer processes communicating through predefined, validated IPC channels.

#### 4.1.2. Renderer Process Architecture
Renderer processes host the application's user interface, built with modern web technologies including React, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS. Each renderer process operates in a sandboxed environment with limited system access, communicating with the main process through secure IPC channels.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- User interface rendering and interaction handling
- Client-side state management using Zustand
- Form validation and data processing with Zod
- Theme management and UI responsiveness
- User authentication flows and session management
- Real-time data synchronization with the main process

**Performance Optimization:**
Renderer processes are optimized for performance through code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient state management. Webpack's hot module replacement enables rapid development cycles, while production builds are optimized for minimal bundle size and fast loading times.

### 4.2. Technology Integration Architecture

#### 4.2.1. Electron Forge and Webpack Configuration
Electron Forge provides the foundation for the application's build and packaging system, integrated with Webpack for advanced bundling capabilities. The configuration supports both development and production environments with optimized settings for each.

**Webpack Configuration Structure:**
The application utilizes separate Webpack configurations for the main and renderer processes, each optimized for their specific requirements. The main process configuration focuses on Node.js compatibility and native module handling, while the renderer configuration emphasizes web optimization and asset management.

**Development Environment:**
The development setup includes hot module replacement for the renderer process, automatic restart capabilities for the main process, and comprehensive source mapping for debugging. Webpack Dev Server provides live reloading and efficient development asset serving.

**Production Optimization:**
Production builds implement advanced optimization techniques including tree shaking, code splitting, and asset compression. The configuration ensures minimal bundle sizes while maintaining compatibility across target platforms.

#### 4.2.2. State Management with Zustand
Zustand provides lightweight, efficient state management for the renderer processes, offering a simple API that scales well with application complexity. The state management architecture supports both local component state and global application state.

**Store Architecture:**
The application implements a modular store structure with separate stores for different application domains (authentication, settings, data, UI state). Each store is designed to be independent yet capable of cross-store communication when necessary.

**Persistence Integration:**
Zustand's persistence middleware integrates with Electron Store through the main process, ensuring that critical application state persists across sessions. The persistence layer handles serialization, deserialization, and migration of state data.

**Performance Considerations:**
State updates are optimized to minimize re-renders through selective subscriptions and computed values. The architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous state updates, with proper error handling and loading states.

#### 4.2.3. Database Integration with Better-sqlite3
Better-sqlite3 provides high-performance, synchronous SQLite database operations within the main process. The database architecture supports complex queries, transactions, and data integrity while maintaining excellent performance characteristics.

**Database Schema Design:**
The database schema is designed with normalization principles, supporting efficient queries and data relationships. Tables are structured to support the application's core features while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

**Query Optimization:**
Database queries are optimized through proper indexing, prepared statements, and efficient query patterns. The architecture supports both simple CRUD operations and complex analytical queries.

**Data Validation and Integrity:**
Zod schemas define the structure and validation rules for all database operations, ensuring data integrity at both the application and database levels. The validation layer prevents invalid data from entering the database while providing clear error messages for debugging.

#### 4.2.4. Authentication Architecture
The authentication system integrates Better-auth with OAuth2 providers, supporting multiple authentication methods while maintaining security best practices. The architecture handles token management, session persistence, and secure communication between authentication components.

**OAuth2 Flow Implementation:**
The OAuth2 implementation follows the Authorization Code Grant flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security. The flow utilizes external browser windows for authentication, ensuring that sensitive credentials never pass through the application's renderer processes.

**Token Management:**
Authentication tokens are securely stored in the main process using Electron Store with encryption. The token management system handles refresh token rotation, automatic token renewal, and secure token transmission to renderer processes.

**Session Management:**
User sessions are managed through secure, encrypted storage with automatic expiration and renewal capabilities. The session management system supports multiple concurrent sessions and provides seamless user experience across application restarts.
